SYSTEM ROLE: You are a Lead Graphics & Engine Developer.TASK: Reconstruct the "WEB-STRIKE: TITAN ELITE" prototype engine from scratch.OUTPUT FORMAT: Single HTML file. NO EXTERNAL ASSETS (Images/Audio/Models). Everything must be procedurally generated via code.
TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT (STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED):
1. VISUAL INTERFACE (CSS/DOM):

Aesthetic: "High-Tech Military". Use CSS Variables: --primary: #eebc51, --bg: #0b0c0e, --hud-bg: rgba(10, 15, 20, 0.9).
Post-Processing: Implement a CSS-based vignette (box-shadow inset) and a grain overlay using a base64 SVG noise filter.
Loading Screen: Fake "Uplink" loader with a glowing progress bar.
HUD: Skewed containers (transform: skewX(-5deg)). Components: Mini-map (Canvas), Killfeed (CSS Animation), Weapon Info, Health/Armor bars (Gradients).
Menus: Radial gradient backgrounds with backdrop-filter blur. Include a "Server Browser" dummy UI.
2. PROCEDURAL ASSET GENERATION (TextureFactory Class):

Texture Engine: Create a static class that generates THREE.CanvasTexture using the HTML5 Canvas API (2D Context).
createConcrete: Grey background with random pixel noise.
createBrick: Loop to draw offset rectangles (running bond pattern).
createCrate: Brown fill with an "X" stroke and border.
3. PROCEDURAL AUDIO ENGINE (AudioSys Class):

Requirement: Use AudioContext. NO <audio> tags.
Noise Generator: Create a 2-second white noise buffer for gunshots/steps.
Synthesizer Functions:
AK47: Sawtooth oscillator + Lowpass filter sweep + Noise burst.
AWP: Square wave (heavy distortion) + long decay.
Hit: High-pitch Triangle wave ping.
Bomb Plant: Sine wave frequency ramp up.
4. GAME WORLD & PHYSICS (World Class):

Layout: "De_Dust2" Approximation.
Hardcode specific map zones: CT Spawn, T Spawn, Long A, Tunnels, Site B.
Use THREE.BoxGeometry for everything (Floor, Walls, Ramps).
Navigation: Implement a custom Pathfinder class using A* (A-Star) logic. Manually define nodes (x, z) and connections (connect('CT', 'Mid')) for bot traversal.
5. ENTITIES & AI (Player & Bot Classes):

Weapons: Create composite THREE.Group models using primitives (Box/Cylinder) for: AK47, AWP (with Scope), Glock, Knife.
Bot Logic:
State Machine: Pathing (A* movement) -> Combat (Raycast visibility check + Reaction timer).
Bomb Logic: Terrorist bots must path to Site A/B to plant. CT bots must path to bomb to defuse.
Stuck Check: If position hasn't changed in 0.5s, apply random jitter vector.
6. GAMEPLAY LOOP:

Combat: Raycasting from camera center. Recoil affects camera rotation (lerp back to center).
Particles: ParticleSys class using THREE.Points and BufferGeometry. Types: Blood (red, high gravity), Sparks (yellow), Muzzle Flash.
Game Rules: Round timer (2 mins). Win conditions: Elimination or Bomb Detonation/Defusal. Team Score tracking.
